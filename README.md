# ON CHAIN Dart Package

Onchain Plugin for Dartâ€”an advanced cross-platform solution that seamlessly integrates with Ethereum, Tron, Solana, Cardano, Aptos, and Sui blockchains. It supports key Ethereum standards such as Legacy, EIP1559, EIP2930, and EIP712, providing developers with powerful tools for transactions, smart contracts, and token management.

this plugin enables:

- Tron: Account creation, asset transfers, native operations, and smart contract execution.
- Solana: Metaplex integration, token management, staking, and smart contracts.
- Cardano: Legacy and Shelley-era support, staking, pools, and transactions.
- Aptos & Sui: Encoding/decoding of Move types, transaction management, and smart contract interactions.
This package streamlines blockchain development across multiple ecosystems, making it a comprehensive toolkit for Dart developers.


## Features

### Ethereum Network

- Sign (Transaction, Personal Signing): Enable secure transaction and personal data signing within your Dart applications, ensuring cryptographic integrity and authentication.

- EIP1559: Embrace the efficiency of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, optimizing transaction fee mechanisms for enhanced predictability and user experience.

- EIP2930 (Access List): Streamline contract interactions with the Ethereum blockchain using Access Lists, enhancing efficiency and reducing transaction costs by specifying accounts with direct access permissions.

- Interact with Contract: Seamlessly engage with Ethereum smart contracts, unlocking the full potential of decentralized applications through efficient contract interactions within your Dart projects.

- Interact with Ethereum Node (JSON RPC): Facilitate direct communication with Ethereum nodes through JSON RPC, enabling your Dart applications to access and query blockchain data in a standardized and efficient manner.

- EIP712 (Legacy, v3, v4): Implement Ethereum Improvement Proposal 712 standards for structured and secure message signing, supporting legacy as well as versions 3 and 4 to ensure compatibility and compliance across diverse Ethereum ecosystems.

- HD-Wallet: Manage mnemonic generation, seed derivation, and address creation

### Tron Network


- Sign (Transaction, Personal Signing) for Tron: Securely authorize Tron transactions and sign personal data within your Dart applications, ensuring cryptographic integrity and user authentication.

- Multi-Signature: Enhance security and decentralized decision-making on the Tron blockchain with multi-signature capabilities. Enable collaboration by requiring multiple cryptographic signatures for transactions, reinforcing trust and integrity within the Tron network. Empower your Dart applications with sophisticated multi-signature functionality for a resilient and collaborative approach to transaction authorization on Tron.

- Interact with Tron Smart Contract: Seamlessly engage with Tron's smart contracts, enabling your Dart projects to execute and manage transactions on the Tron blockchain with ease.

- Create Tron Native Contract Transactions: Effortlessly initiate a wide array of Tron native contract transactions, including account creation, asset transfers, voting, smart contract creation, and more. Explore a comprehensive list of supported contract operations tailored for Tron's blockchain.

- Interact with Tron HTTP Node: Facilitate direct communication with Tron's blockchain through HTTP nodes, allowing your Dart applications to query and interact with Tron's network in a standardized and efficient manner.

- All Features of Tron: Harness the full potential of Tron's blockchain by leveraging all its features, including shielded transfers, market transactions, resource delegation, contract management, and more. Empower your Dart applications with comprehensive functionality for a rich and dynamic Tron blockchain experience.
